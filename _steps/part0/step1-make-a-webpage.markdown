We are going to be learning about JavaScript using your web browser.  

To do that we will create a very simple webpage and use it to load up our Javascript in the browser.  

So what is a web page really?

It's just a text file with two different types of content in it.

1. text content, ie the actual words that will be displayed
2. html tags, which tell the browser how the content is supposed to be displayed.

It's easier to demonstrate than explain, so lets create one.

1. create a text file, call it `index.html` and type out the following content in it:

```HTML
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My awesome webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>hi there!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
