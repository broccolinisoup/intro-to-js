#### CONSOLE.LOG()

Let's continue with getting your code on the screen.

There are a few ways you can do it and we will look into a few of them:

```javascript
console.log('Hello World!');
```

This line of code will print 'Hello World!' to the browser's console.

NOTE: To see the browser's console you can right click on the window of your
browser (Chrome, Firefox etc) and select 'Inspect' or 'Inspect element'.
After that a console will appear on the bottom right side of the page.

#### ALERT()

```javascript
alert('Hello girls!');
```
This line of code will pop-up a small window in your browser with the text
'Hello girls!' in it, but you need to refresh the opened page first.


#### COMMENTS 
Let's start with comments.

```javascript
// This is a comment
```
Comments are notes that people can read and computers will ignore.

```javascript
// This is a single line comment.
```

```javascript
/*
  Multi-line comments look like this.
  You can use comments to write a description for your code block 
  or notes. 
*/
```

#### TASKS TO DO

1. Try to console.log the message to the browser. Send any message you like.
2. Try to create an alert with any phrase you like.
3. Comment out your alert code  (put `//` on the line where your code is and save the changes). After you refresh the page, it should not pop-up anymore.
