So hopefully you have completed the workshop and tried a couple of the challenges.  

But this is just the tip of the iceberg for Node.js.  There is a whole internet of technologies and tutorials at your fingertips.  Here are some starting points about where you could go next.  

## Other Node Tutorials

### Free
* [NodeSchool "Workshoppers"](https://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers) have really great interactive tutorials for all sorts of Node technologies.

### Paid
* [Udemy: Learn and Understand NodeJS](https://www.udemy.com/understand-nodejs/learn/v4/)
* [egghead.io: Node Fundamentals](https://egghead.io/courses/introduction-to-node-the-fundamentals)


## Git and Source Control

If you used Cloud9 for this workshop then you also created a GitHub account.  GitHub is a website for sharing and collaborating on code using the tool Git.  Git is a **source control management** tool.   Git is not the only tool of this type but it is very popular and widely used both in industry and open-source projects.

* [GitHub: Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/)
* [Pro Git 2nd Edition free online book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

**Advice:** There *are* some great GUI tools available for Git such as [Git Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/mac/), [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), and [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/).  However it is easy to get over confident with these tools and get tripped up once you get to advanced usage unless you have a solid understanding of how Git works.  For that reason it is highly advised to become familar with git on the command-line to get a better understanding of it.  Even if you also use the GUI tools to make some tasks easier.
